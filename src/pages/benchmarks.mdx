Leveraging our experience with Node.js performance, Fastify has been built from the ground up to be **as fast as possible**.

All the code used for our benchmarks is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks/).

Here's a brief summary on how Fastify overhead performed against the some other well known Node.js web frameworks:

Please note that this is a synthetic, "hello world" benchmark that aims to evaluate the framework overhead. The overhead that each framework has on your application depends on your application, **you should always benchmark if performance matters to you**.
