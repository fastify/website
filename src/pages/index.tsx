                  An efficient server implies a lower cost of the
                  infrastructure, a better responsiveness under load and happy
                  users. How can you efficiently handle the resources of your
                  server, knowing that you are serving the highest number of
                  requests possible, without sacrificing security validations
                  and handy development?
