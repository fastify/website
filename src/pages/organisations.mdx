## How to be featured here

Is your organisation using Fastify? That's great!

If you would like your organisation to have its logo featured in this list:

1. Start contributing to the Fastify project following the [contributing guide](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and read the [on boarding process](https://github.com/fastify/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#collaborator-nominations).

Or become a [Tier 3 or 4 financial supporter](https://github.com/sponsors/fastify)!

2. Fork the [Fastify website repository](https://github.com/fastify/website) on GitHub

3. Add the logo in the `static/img/organisations` folder.

Please make sure that your logo complies to the following specs:

- Encoded in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format
- Be reasonably optimized/minified _(you can use [imageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/))_
- Make sure image "width" or "height" are explicitly specified in the "svg" tag

3. Update the `static/data/organisations.yml` file with a new entry

Your entry must provide:

- `name`: the name of your organisation
- `image`: the filename of the logo you added in the previous step
- `link`: a link to a website that represents your organisation
- `sponsor`: a boolean value that indicates if your organisation is a financial supporter
- `tier`: the tier of your financial support (it can be `tier_3` or `tier_4`)

4. Submit the PR!

As soon as your PR is reviewed and merged, your awesome logo will appear in this page!
