- There are <PluginCount plugins={plugins.corePlugins}/> core plugins and <PluginCount plugins={plugins.communityPlugins}/> community plugins
- A core plugin is a plugin maintained by the Fastify team, and we do our best to maintain them according to the Fastify [Long Term Support](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/docs/Reference/LTS.md) policy
- We guarantee that every community plugin respects Fastify best practices (tests, etc) at the time they have been added to the list. We offer no guarantee on their maintenance
- Can't find the plugin you're looking for? No problem, <Link to='/docs/latest/Guides/Write-Plugin'>you can learn how to do it!</Link>
