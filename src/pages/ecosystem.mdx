## Ecosystem 

- <PluginsCount/>
- A core plugin is a plugin maintained by the fastify team, and we make our best to maintain them according to https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/Reference/docs/LTS.md.
- We guarantee that every community plugin respects Fastify best practices (tests, etc) at the time they have been added to the list. We offer no guarantee on their maintenance.
- Can't find the plugin you're looking for? No problem, [it's easy to write one!](https://www.fastify.io/docs/master/Reference/Plugins)
