## Ecosystem 

- <PluginsCount/>
- A core plugin is a plugin maintained by the fastify team, and we do our best to maintain them according to the Fastify [Long Term Support]( https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/docs/Reference/LTS.md) policy.
- We guarantee that every community plugin respects Fastify best practices (tests, etc) at the time they have been added to the list. We offer no guarantee on their maintenance.
- Can't find the plugin you're looking for? No problem, <Link to='plugins'>it's easy to write one!</Link>
