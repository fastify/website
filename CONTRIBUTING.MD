## üìù Commit message guidelines

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

Basic rules:

Supported subsystems:
> build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test

* Commit messages **must** start with a capital letter

* Commit messages **must not** end with a period `.`

## üìú Pull Request Policy

### Before merging

* Pull Requests must be open for at least 12 hours.
  * Pull requests might be immediately merged if they contain critical bug fixes, short erratas (e.g. typos from previous PRs) or any critical change that is considered a "showstopper" for the operation of the website.
    * These kind of PRs should only be done by existing collaborators that have write-access and/or signed-off by administrators/maintainers.
* There must be no objections after a 24 hour period
* Fast track is allowed for collaborators.

Each contribution is accepted only if there is no objection to it by a collaborator. During the review, collaborators may request that a specific contributor who is an expert in a particular area give an "LGTM" (looks good to me) before the PR can be merged.

In the case that an objection is raised in a pull request by another collaborator, all collaborators involved should try to arrive at a consensus by addressing the concerns through discussion, compromise, or withdrawal of the proposed change(s).

### When merging

* `squash` pull requests made up of multiple commits

## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual who creates an issue/PR, comments on an issue/PR
  or contributes in some other way.
* A **Collaborator** is a contributor with write access to the repository. See [here](#becoming-a-collaborator) on how to become a collaborator.
