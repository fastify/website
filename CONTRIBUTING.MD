## Pull Request Policy

### Before merging

This repository follows the same rules as a Fastify plugin repository. A detailed process is explained at [fastify/CONTRIBUTING.md#rules](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#rules)

## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual who creates an issue/PR, comments on an issue/PR
  or contributes in some other way.
* A **Collaborator** is a contributor with write access to the repository. See [here](#becoming-a-collaborator) on how to become a collaborator.

## Becoming a collaborator

## Debugging failing checks

```bash
npm run format
```
